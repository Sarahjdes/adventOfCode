# AdventOfCode

These are my adventOfCode scripts! I hope to be able to work on them everyday. 


## Goals

1. Work on them daily and achieve them daily!
2. As much as possible, use Python. (I might use some JavaScript and Bash here and there, but I really wish I can achieve this using only Python.)
3. Between Christmas and New Year's Eve, I'd like to take the time to polish them.
